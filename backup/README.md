This action uses the GitHub App credentials to clone all the repositories from the organization, and store them as tar.gz file in GitHub Action artifact, Google Storage Bucket, AWS S3 or any combination of them.

## Usage

GitHub Action artifact:
```yaml
    artifact_enabled: true
    artifact_retention: <days>
```

Google Storage Bucket:
```yaml
    gcp_enabled: true
    gcp_bucket: <bucket name>
    gcp_sa_key: <service account key>
```

AWS S3:
```yaml
    aws_enabled: true
    aws_region: <aws region>
    aws_s3: <bucket name>
    aws_access_key_id: <aws access key id>
    aws_secret_access_key: <aws secret access key>
```
